* Created in python 3, run in https://www.streamlit.io/

* To run the project (after downloading project folder and installing streamlit), navigate to the project folder within terminal and use the command: 
    streamlit run COVID19_app.py
    
* Note: JHU is currently updating their data set, so the second part of this project (containing the US state data) will be updated once the state data has been returned/redirected to a new repository. -MW, 3/26/2020
